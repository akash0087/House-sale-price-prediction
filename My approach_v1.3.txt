Approach that I've followed:

********** Data Pre-processing step ************

I didn't delete any rows having NaNs and -ve values. 

1) I've treated the NaNs using Median and Mode statistical approach.

2) I've treated the -ve values using abs() function.

Instead of removing the rows which are were having these values, I opted to pre-process them.


********** Choosing the attributes for prediction ************

1) Initially I've removed column: ['Customer_name'].

2) Later, we made use of SelectKBest with chi2 function to select meaningful attributes.
